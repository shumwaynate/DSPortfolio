# My Interests and Background
I am a student at BYU studying computer science. I am interested in software development and data science. I have experience with Java, Python, and C++. I have also worked with SQL and NoSQL databases. I am currently learning about machine learning and data analysis. I am excited to learn more about these topics and apply them to real-world problems. 

I enjoy eating good food, watching funny movies, and spending time with my family. I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I served a mission in the Brimingham, Alabama mission. I am married and have a son on the way! I am excited to see what the future holds for me and my family.
